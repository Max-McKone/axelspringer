  <h2 id="conceptsTitle">Key Concepts</h2>
  <div id="conceptsContent">
    <h3>Web Servers</h3>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server" class="terms">Web servers</a> are powerful computers that store,
    process, and deliver webpages to
    users. When you request a webpage by entering a URL into your browser, the
    browser sends a request to the appropriate web server, which then fetches
    and transmits the requested page back to your browser.
    <h3>Web Browsers</h3>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser" class="terms">Web browsers</a> are software applications used to
    access and navigate the Web.
    <u>Popular web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft
      Edge, and Apple Safari.</u>
    Browsers interpret and display HTML documents, allowing users to view and
    interact with webpages.
    <h3>Hyperlinks</h3>
    Also known simply as links, these are references in a document that the
    user can click on to navigate to another document or resource. Hyperlinks
    are a fundamental feature of the Web, enabling the interconnected nature
    of web content.
    <h3>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</h3>
    HTML is the standard language for creating webpages. It uses a series of
    tags to structure text, images, and other content on a webpage. HTML is
    essential for defining the layout and appearance of web documents.

      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h2 id="historyTitle">History and Evolution</h2>
  <div class="historyContent">
    <p>
      The World Wide Web was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while he
      was working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. His
      vision was to create a system for sharing information among scientists
      across the globe. Berners-Lee wrote the first web browser and web server
      software and proposed the concept of the Web in a pioneering document
      titled "Information Management: A Proposal."
    </p>
    <p>
      The first website, <a href="http://info.cern.ch/" class="terms">info.cern.ch</a>, was launched on August 6, 1991. This
      site provided an explanation of what the World Wide Web was and how to
      use a browser and set up a web server. The initial idea quickly gained
      traction, and the Web began to grow exponentially.
    </p>
    <p>
      In April 1993, CERN made the technology of the World Wide Web available
      on a royalty-free basis, which played a crucial role in its widespread
      adoption. This openness led to the creation of web browsers such as
      Mosaic, which later evolved into Netscape Navigator, one of the first
      widely used web browsers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Web has since seen numerous technological advancements. The
      introduction of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) allowed for more
      sophisticated webpage layouts and designs. JavaScript brought
      interactivity and dynamic content to the Web. The development of web
      standards by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), founded by
      Berners-Lee, helped ensure the Web remained open and accessible.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="futureTitle">The Future of the World Wide Web</h2>
  <div class="futureContent">
    <p>
      As the Web continues to evolve, several trends and technologies are
      shaping its future. One significant trend is the rise of the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web" class="terms">Semantic Web</a>, an extension of the current Web
      in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling
      computers and people to work in cooperation. The goal is to make web
      content more accessible and useful by integrating data from different
      sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another important development is the increasing use of <span class="terms">Artificial
        Intelligence (AI)</span> and machine learning on the Web. AI-powered
      applications can provide more personalized user experiences, improve
      search engine results, and enhance online security.
    </p>
    <p>
      The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) is also expanding the
      boundaries of the Web. IoT connects everyday objects to the internet,
      allowing them to send and receive data. This connectivity can lead to
      smarter homes, cities, and industries, all interacting seamlessly with
      the Web.
    </p>
    <p>
      Privacy and security remain critical concerns as the Web evolves.
      Efforts to develop more robust encryption methods and privacy standards
      are ongoing. Technologies such as blockchain are being explored for
      their potential to enhance security and trust on the Web.
    </p>
    <p>
      The concept of Web 3.0, or the decentralized web, is gaining traction.
      Web 3.0 aims to create a more open and user-centric internet, where
      users have greater control over their data and interactions. It leverages
      technologies like blockchain to decentralize data storage and
      management, reducing reliance on centralized servers and platforms.
