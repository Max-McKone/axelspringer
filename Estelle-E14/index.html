      The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" class="terms">World Wide Web (WWW)</a>, commonly known
      as
      the <span class="terms">Web</span>, is a vast information network that
      operates over the internet. It consists of interconnected documents and
      resources linked by hyperlinks and accessed via web browsers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u><em>The Web should not be confused with the internet itself</em></u>, which is
      the underlying network of computers. The Web is one of the many services
      that run on the internet, similar to email and file sharing.

  <h2 id="conceptsTitle">Key Concepts</h2>
  <div id="conceptsContent">
    <h3>Web Servers</h3>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server" class="terms">Web servers</a> are powerful computers that store,
    process, and deliver webpages to
    users. When you request a webpage by entering a URL into your browser, the
    browser sends a request to the appropriate web server, which then fetches
    and transmits the requested page back to your browser.
    <h3>Web Browsers</h3>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser" class="terms">Web browsers</a> are software applications used to
    access and navigate the Web.
    <u>Popular web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft
      Edge, and Apple Safari.</u>
    Browsers interpret and display HTML documents, allowing users to view and
    interact with webpages.
    <h3>Hyperlinks</h3>
    Also known simply as links, these are references in a document that the
    user can click on to navigate to another document or resource. Hyperlinks
    are a fundamental feature of the Web, enabling the interconnected nature
    of web content.
    <h3>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</h3>
    HTML is the standard language for creating webpages. It uses a series of
    tags to structure text, images, and other content on a webpage. HTML is
    essential for defining the layout and appearance of web documents.
