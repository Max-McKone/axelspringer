                    <h3>Selection Sort in Practice</h3>
                    <p>Selection sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items. Its average and worst-case time complexity is (O(n^2)), where n is the number of items being sorted.</p>

                    <h3>Insertion Sort in Practice</h3>
                    <p>Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time, by repeatedly picking the next item and inserting it into the correct position among the previously sorted items. Its average and worst-case time complexity is (O(n^2)), where n is the number of items being sorted.</p>
